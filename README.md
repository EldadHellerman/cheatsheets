# cheatsheets
I'm always confused after switching between programming languages about what exactly this language has and what it doesn't.
And I can never remember how to initialize an array in Java ðŸ˜„

So I decided to make my own cheatsheets of everything I've learned, so I can easily get up to speed when returning to an old language.
